# Social-Application

The name of this project is Social and this project is Web Application written in PHP.
This Web Application is similar to the other Social Networks Web Applications.

The Working environment that I used is XAMPP which stands for a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts.

The Front-End part of the web app is written in HTML,CSS and there are some code in JavaScript but the Back-End is written in PHP and also
I used MariaDB database.
